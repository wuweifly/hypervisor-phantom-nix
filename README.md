## Introduction

Virtual machines (VMs) are widely used in cloud computing and software development. However, they can also be vulnerable to various types of attacks, including malware and unauthorized access. Hypervisor-Phantom addresses these vulnerabilities by providing a framework for hardening VMs. This Nix port allows you to easily deploy and manage the tool within a NixOS environment.

## Features

- **VM Hardening**: Apply security measures to your VMs to reduce the attack surface.
- **Easy Installation**: Use Nix to install and manage dependencies effortlessly.
- **Integration with KVM**: Seamlessly integrates with Kernel-based Virtual Machine (KVM) for enhanced performance.
- **Malware Analysis**: Analyze and detect potential threats in your VMs.
- **Undetected Operation**: Operate without detection from common security tools.
